# Project Vostok
Hello and welcome to my project repo! Here you will find the schematic files and firmware files (eventually) pertaining to my project!

## What is Project Vostok?
A few months back, I bought myself a [TV-B-Gone](http://www.tvbgone.com/) (a gag device that allows you to turn off any TV). After 
having some fun playing around and trolling people with it I had an idea of extending the device to add more functionality. 

The device in its original form ejected the IR codes in a sequential mannar, there was no way of selecting the TV to be turned off beforehand.
This means that if your TV was at the bottom of the list, it could take up to a minute (!!!) for your TV to turn off. From a trolling efficiency 
perspective, this is clearly not ideal!

To that end, this project extends the TV-B-Gone in the following way:
  - Add headers to allow for a LCD screen to be mounted
  - Add a rotary encoder with a push button to allow the GUI to be navigatable
  - Use of a bigger microcontroller to allow for more IO Pins and extended functionality
  
The original design notes for the TV-B-Gone are avaliable [here](https://cdn-learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/tv-b-gone-kit.pdf)

These are the people that have helped make this project a reality:
  - [Mitch Altman](http://www.tvbgone.com/about-us/) - the creator of TV-B-Gone! Obviously without him I wouldn't have had the basis
  for this project
  - [Kier Davis](http://kierdavis.com/) - a (great) friend at university who taught me numerous things about PCB design and embedded 
  programming and offered his time and effort into verifying that my design would work as intended!
  - [ninjafrostpn](https://github.com/ninjafrostpn) - another amazing Marine Biologist friend who supported and encouraged me to carry
  on even when things were slow!
  - The lab technicians on Level 2 of the Zepler Building at the University of Southampton - these wonderful people helped immensely in 
  sourcing components and providing general help and guidance!
